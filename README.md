correct-csv-parser-xquery
=========================

Author: Matthew Royal

This CSV parser correctly parses CSV files with escaped quotation marks ("") 
and carriage returns in column data. It is probably slower than other parsers, 
because the XQuery language standard does not support several key Regex features
and relies on parsing the file one character at a time instead.

If your column data contains these escaped characters, to my knowledge this is 
currently the only XQuery-based CSV-to-XML converter that can parse them properly.
If your data contains no such escape sequences, you will get much better performance
using a different parser.

GRAMMAR:
```
 file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]
 header = field *(COMMA field)
 record = field *(COMMA field)
 field = (escaped / non-escaped)
 escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE
 non-escaped = *TEXTDATA
 COMMA = %x2C
 CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]
 DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]
 LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]
 CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]
 TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E
```

Parameters:
  $file as xs:string -- contents of CSV file to parse
  $header as xs:boolean -- indicates that the first row of the file is the header.
